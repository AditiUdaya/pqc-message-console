Title:
🔐 Post-Quantum Military Communication System

Description:
This project demonstrates a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)-based communication system built using Flask and the Open Quantum Safe (liboqs) library.
It simulates a secure communication protocol between military devices (e.g., soldiers, HQ, drones) that remains resistant to quantum attacks.
